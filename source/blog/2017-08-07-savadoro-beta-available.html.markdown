SavvySoftWorks, LLC is proud to announce the Savadoro timer.

Savadoro is Pomodoro Technique timer, while this is still in a very early beta stage, we have big ideas for the timer long term. Including integration into Slack as well as the ability to track you and your teams past progress.

For a little background, per [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique](Wikipedia) the Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique developed in the late 1980s. Basically, you decide upon a task, then set the timer for 25 minutes. After the timer expires you take a short 3-5 minute break, and then repeat. after 4 times through the cycle you take a longer 15-20 minute break.

This technique helps you stay on task as it creates specific periods of focus on a designated task. It also helps you avoid the perverbial "rabbit hole" of getting lost in a specific problem for too long, as the timer will interupt you at the designated time. Giving you a "brain break" or allowing you a pause to seek help.

The timer itself is free for you to try, and is available for download at out Github page. [https://github.com/SavvySoftWorksLLC/savadoro_electron/releases](https://github.com/SavvySoftWorksLLC/savadoro_electron/releases)
