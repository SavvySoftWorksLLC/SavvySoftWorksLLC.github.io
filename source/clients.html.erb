            We rescued the LoveBettie site from the depths of a hacked state that had been blocked by Google as "unsafe." Still a work in progress, our first steps were to rescue the site and install a new landing page and calendar. Our second task was to begin the launch of a separate website for their new band, WillowHill.

            Helped GCCHS start a world class computer science curriculum teaching software design and implementation with JavaScript and HTML Game Development.

          <h6>Computer Science Through Game Development Curriculum</h6>
          <p>
            Using game development to engage students, educators can explore the full range of the problem -> solution -> implementation process that produces something students can physically take with them in their future pursuits. Using low impedance tools like web browsers, JavaScript, and HTML5 Canvas we solve complex visual and logical problems building a solid base of software development skills.

            Through a partnership between 3D Systems and the Westmoreland ATC we produced a curriculum and lab materials to teach educators how to use complex desktop additive manufacturing and build their own curriculums to educate high school and vocational programs to prepare students for the high tech manufacturing jobs of the future. We also use the same course material to produce a credit course through WCCC that will help make the ATC an area of focus for additive manufacturing in the greater Pittsburgh Area.
